The Library Management System is a console-based Java application designed to handle essential library functions such as issuing and returning books. This project focuses on implementing two key programming concepts: exception handling and multithreading. By integrating these features, the system ensures smooth and reliable operations even when multiple users access it concurrently.

Exception handling in this system plays a critical role in managing invalid operations. For example, if a user attempts to issue a book that does not exist in the library or tries to return a book that was never issued, the program raises custom exceptions with clear, user-friendly error messages. This approach not only improves the system’s robustness but also enhances the user experience by preventing unexpected crashes.

Multithreading is utilized to simulate a real-world environment where several users may perform library operations simultaneously. By using synchronized methods, the system ensures that shared resources such as the book inventory remain consistent and free from data conflicts even when accessed by multiple threads. This feature demonstrates how concurrency can be managed effectively in Java applications.

The project structure includes various classes: Book to represent book entities, BookNotFoundException for custom exceptions, Library to manage book operations with thread-safe methods, LibraryTask to handle multithreaded operations, and LibraryManagementSystem as the main class that coordinates the application’s execution.

Overall, this Library Management System serves as a practical example of how exception handling and multithreading can be combined to create a reliable, user-friendly, and efficient application. It is ideal for students and developers looking to understand and implement these concepts in real-world scenarios.
